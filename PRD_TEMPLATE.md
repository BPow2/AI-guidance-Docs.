# PRD.md — [Project Name] Product Requirements

<!--
  HOW TO USE THIS TEMPLATE:
  1. Replace all [bracketed placeholders] with your project-specific content
  2. Read the guidance comments for tips on what to include
  3. Delete all guidance comments before sharing with AI or team members
-->

## App Overview

<!--
  2-3 sentences: what does this app do, who is it for, and what's the core workflow?
  Be specific — this grounds the AI on what it's building.
-->

[Brief description of what this app does, who it's for, and the core value it provides.]

---

## What This App IS

<!--
  3-5 bullets that define the scope, nature, and boundaries of the project.
  Be specific — these prevent scope creep.
-->

- [Core identity — e.g., "A CLI tool that...", "A web app that...", "A Python library that..."]
- [User interaction model — e.g., "User reviews and approves before acting"]
- [Maturity level — e.g., "A prototype/demo, not a production system"]

## What This App IS NOT

<!--
  Equally important. Explicitly call out what this project should NOT become.
  This prevents the AI from over-building.
-->

- [Anti-pattern — e.g., "A bulk processing tool"]
- [Out-of-scope system — e.g., "A full CRM or database-backed platform"]
- [Autonomy boundary — e.g., "A fully autonomous agent that acts without user approval"]

---

## Features

<!--
  GUIDELINES:
  - Each feature = a distinct module or functional area
  - Use checkboxes so you can track completion
  - Be specific and testable — avoid vague requirements
  - Include error handling and edge cases within each feature
  - Order features in the sequence they'll be built (should match PLAN.md)
  - Aim for 4-8 requirements per feature
-->

### Feature 1: [Feature Name]

* [ ] [Requirement — what input does this accept or what triggers it?]
* [ ] [Requirement — what's the core processing logic?]
* [ ] [Requirement — what output does the user get?]
* [ ] [Requirement — how are errors handled?]

### Feature 2: [Feature Name]

* [ ] [Requirement]
* [ ] [Requirement]
* [ ] [Requirement]
* [ ] [Requirement]

### Feature 3: [Feature Name]

* [ ] [Requirement]
* [ ] [Requirement]

## Test Data / Resources

<!--
  Optional. List sample inputs, test URLs, APIs, or datasets for verifying the app works.
  Saves time and gives the AI concrete examples to test against.
-->

* [Test input 1]
* [Test input 2]
* [Test input 3]

---

## Success Criteria

<!--
  Optional. Define what "done" looks like for the overall project.
-->

- [ ] [End-to-end flow works without errors across multiple inputs]
- [ ] [Output quality bar — e.g., "Results are specific to the input, not generic"]
- [ ] [Reliability — e.g., "Works on at least 3 different test cases without crashing"]
